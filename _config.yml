description: I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zagreb, specializing in natural language processing. I obtained my PhD in 2025 from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, under the supervision of [Jan Šnajder](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/jan.snajder). I also completed my bachelor’s and master’s studies at the same faculty. During my master’s program, I received the Rector’s Award for scientific research and twice won Croatia’s largest data science competition, LUMEN. Since 2021, I have been employed as an assistant at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing and am a member of [TakeLab](https://takelab.fer.hr/), where I lead the [TakeLab Retriever](https://retriever.takelab.fer.hr/) project.
